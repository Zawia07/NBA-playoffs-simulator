This was initially a 'draft' that I created in order to simulate the tournament system for my Data Structure assignment. Sadly however the assignemnt question listed that it wanted us to create a tourney system for our university's Esports team(lame) so I ended up scraping the data structure elements(queues) and finished this quickly so that I can at least have a basic idea of what I am going to end up doing later! You can just download the source files on any C++ compiler and it would run with no issue. I hope you enjoy your time and check out my other projects(if you're reading within post's publishing timeline then you'd be confused because I haven't uploaded anything yet and that's because this is still my first project ( at least on github)) Yeah ttyl. 

for a fun easter egg Plata O Plomo iykykykyk
